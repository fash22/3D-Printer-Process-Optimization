# Machine Learning and 3D Printing: A Data-Driven Approach to Quality Optimization
A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding and Improving Print Quality
---
## Introduction
Product quality is a crucial factor for business growth and success in manufacturing. Therefore, manufacturing engineers should aim to produce and maintain high-quality product yields by optimizing their processes. This requires a deep understanding of the inputs, parameters, outputs and interactions of each process. In this case study, I present my project, Machine Learning and 3D Printing: A Data-Driven Approach to Quality Optimization, which demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to optimize the 3D printing process and understand how different printer settings affect the final print quality. The data analysis framework used in this project can also be generalized to other machines and processes in manufacturing.

## Welcome to My Project
Welcome to Machine Learning and 3D Printing: A Data-Driven Approach to Quality Optimization - A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding and Improving Print Quality. This project is part of my IBM Machine Learning Professional Certification HONORS project for the 1st two courses namely Exploratory Data Analysis, and Supervised Machine Learning: Regression.

3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform manufacturing in various domains, such as aerospace, biomedical, automotive, and more. However, 3D printing also poses many challenges in terms of ensuring high-quality product yields, as the print quality depends on many factors, such as the printer settings, the material properties, the environmental conditions, and the design specifications. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic and data-driven approach to optimize the 3D printing process and understand how different printer settings affect the final print quality.

The main objective of this project is to optimize the 3D printing process and understand how different printer settings affect the final print quality. The main research questions are:

- What are the most important printer settings that influence print quality?
- How do these settings interact with each other and with the material properties?
- How can machine learning models be used to predict and improve print quality based on printer settings?

To answer these questions, I will use the 3D Printer Dataset for Mechanical Engineers from Kaggle, which contains data on 150 samples of 3D printed parts with different printer settings and material properties, along with their corresponding print quality scores. I will use Python and Quarto as my main tools for data analysis. I will perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data structure, distribution, and relationships. I will then apply supervised machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting, to build predictive models for print quality based on printer settings. I will evaluate the performance of these models using various metrics, such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error. I will also analyze the feature importance and interaction effects of these models to gain insights into how printer settings affect print quality.

The expected results of this project are:

- A ranking of the most important printer settings that influence print quality
- A visualization of the interaction effects of printer settings and material properties on print quality
- A comparison of the predictive performance of different machine learning models for print quality
- A recommendation of the optimal printer settings for achieving high-quality product yields

This project will contribute to the field of manufacturing by demonstrating how machine learning can be used to optimize the 3D printing process and understand how different printer settings affect the final print quality. The data analysis framework used in this project can also be generalized to other machines and processes in manufacturing.

I would like to thank my instructors, mentors, peers, reviewers, and data providers for their guidance, feedback, support, and resources for this project. I would also like to acknowledge IBM for providing me with the opportunity to enroll in their Machine Learning Professional Certification program and access their Watson Studio platform.
